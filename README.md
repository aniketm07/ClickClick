## Project Overview

ClickClick offers a range of features designed to provide a seamless user experience:

- **Seamless Login and Upload:** ClickClick offers a seamless login process, allowing users to quickly access their accounts and upload images with ease. This ensures users can share their creations without unnecessary hassle or delays.

- **Tag Subscription:** ClickClick enables users to stay updated with the latest trends and discover new content effortlessly by subscribing to their favorite tags. This feature allows users to receive notifications whenever new posts are made with tags they've subscribed to, ensuring they never miss out on relevant content.

- **Automatic Tag Generation:** ClickClick utilizes Amazon Rekognition, a powerful image recognition service, to automatically generate tags for uploaded images. This makes it easier for users to categorize and search for images based on their interests, enhancing the overall discoverability of their content.

- **Email Notifications:** ClickClick employs Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS) to send email notifications to users who have subscribed to specific tags. Whenever a new post is created with a tag they're subscribed to, users receive an email notification, keeping them informed about new content relevant to their interest.
